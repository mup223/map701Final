    <h3>WWII Persuasive Cartography</h3>

      Since there is a date range of 1940-1949 on this map, it is difficult to determine what the
      overarching intention was, other than the content presented. By this, I mean, if this map
      was produced in 1940, one could argue that it was a ploy to induce support for the US enrance
      into the foreign conflict (prior to Pearl Harbor obviously). If it was produced after 1941, then
      one could surmise that it's intent is merly to give perspective and scale to just how successful
      and serious the German occupation was.
      <br>
      <br>
      As noted in Tyner's <em>Persuasive Cartography</em>, WWII increased interest in maps, and the power
      of propoganda and pursuasive narratives in cartography. Rererncing Hans Speier in Tyner's article,
      he says that propoganda maps are used as "blueprints of the future". It is my opinion that a map
      like this is surely intended to induce fear that the Germans could come to America and do the same
      thing they'd been successful at doing on the Asian continent. A sort of "blueprint" for the minds of
      ordinary people to help them understand the scale and reality of Germany's potential.
      <br>
      <br>
      Through this interacive display, I will highlight some of the WWII battles that led to the German
      victory and occupation. I'll also give you my opinions and how they relate to some of the course
      readings.
